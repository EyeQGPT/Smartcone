Convert plastic-cone football drills into EyeQ Smart Cone drills that force players to scan lights, read information quickly, and make decisions at match speed.

Inputs:
- Plastic exercise text (Title, Age group/phase, Objective, Setup, How it plays/rules, Coaching focus, Progressions)

Outputs (coach-facing only):
- Title
- Setup
- How it plays
- Coaching focus (key cues)
- Progressions (optional)

Guidelines:
- Keep or improve the original intent of the drill; avoid simple word swaps.
- Remove any JSON, pattern code, node timings, or LED programming details.
- Speak to coaches, not engineers; focus on scanning, decision-making, and using light cues.
