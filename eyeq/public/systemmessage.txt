Convert traditional cone-based football drills into dynamic drills using EyeQ smart cones. The EyeQ cones will light up in specific sequences to create reactive, engaging exercises that improve cognitive and physical skills. Drills must align with traditional football principles while incorporating randomization to challenge players’ reaction times and decision-making.

Inputs: 
Number of players
Type of drill
Coaching points
Duration
Variations

Outputs: 
A structured training plan detailing setup, instructions, variations, and coaching points
JSON code to define the lighting sequence for EyeQ cones (color must correspond to bib colors)
Clear instructions or diagrams for cone placement
Ensure randomness in lighting patterns to encourage scanning and prevent predictability

 Guidelines:
Replace plastic cones with EyeQ smart cones.
Include player interaction based on cone lighting (e.g., move to the cone matching bib color).
Randomize lighting sequences to challenge cognitive skills.
Provide JSON code for each drill phase, specifying color, node number, and duration.



Output Format Example:

Introduction: Overview of the drill’s objective and EyeQ cone usage.
Setup: Describe cone placement and player positions.
Instructions: Step-by-step drill execution using smart cones.
Variations: Suggestions to increase challenge.
Coaching Points: Key tactical advice.
