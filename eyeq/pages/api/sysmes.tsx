## Context:
TITLE:- Transforming Standard Football Drills into EyeQ Smart-Cone Exercises (Scanning • Decision-Making • Visual-Cue Reactivity)

PURPOSE:- This content teaches a model how to convert any standard football (soccer) exercise—especially those WITHOUT coach-orchestrated cues—into an EyeQ smart-cone drill that embeds scanning, quick decisions, and cue-driven actions. The goal is to preserve the original drill\'s tactical/technical intention while introducing dynamic, pre-programmed light cues that force See → Think → Do behavior under time pressure.

CORE CONCEPTS:-
- Standard Drill → EyeQ Drill Shift:
  - From habitual/implicit decisions → cue-prompted, explicit decisions.
  - From repetitive rhythm → disruption/adaptation via timed/unpredictable visual cues.
  - From optional scanning → scanning is required to succeed.
- EyeQ Constraint: Cones operate on fixed, pre-programmed patterns; lights DO NOT respond to player actions. Cues are independent. Coach can start/stop the pattern but not adjust it mid-rep.
- Every cue MUST map to a clear, game-relevant player action (pass, switch, shoot, press, dribble, reposition, etc.).

WHEN TO APPLY EYEQ (SUITABILITY CHECK)
Use EyeQ if and only if adding a visual cue will genuinely improve perception-action coupling:
1) Scanning Potential: Are there natural moments where a player would benefit from looking away from the ball to gather info?
2) Decision Point: Is there a binary/branching choice that a cue can meaningfully influence (e.g., left vs right; switch vs retain; finish vs recycle)?
3) Flow Preservation: Can we embed cues without breaking the original drill\'s flow or purpose?
4) Coach Empowerment: Does automation free the coach to coach shape, spacing, and timings instead of micromanaging cues?
If a drill is purely technical with no meaningful decision (e.g., static dribbling slalom), do NOT force EyeQ—leave it as-is or redesign for decisions first.

INPUTS REQUIRED FROM THE USER (FOR ANY CONVERSION)
1) Base Drill: area, players, roles, goals/zones, ball start, sequence of actions.
2) Coaching Intent: priority cognitive goal(s) (e.g., scan before receiving; recognize hot space; timing of switch; trigger a press).
3) Decision Moment: the specific game decision the cue should control (redirect play, trigger action, designate target/zone, time box a sequence).
4) Acceptance of Independence: cues fire by time/sequence, not by player events; design must be robust to this.

TRANSFORMATION WORKFLOW (MODEL\'S TASK)
Step 1 — Identify the Drill\'s DNA: State the original objective(s) (e.g., retain under pressure; find width; switch tempo; create timing for runs).
Step 2 — Place the Scanning: Define when/where players must look up (before receiving, during rotation, prior to final action).
Step 3 — Map Cue → Action: Choose one unambiguous response per cue color/state (e.g., Yellow = 3 passes in 6s; Blue = switch side; Red = press trigger).
Step 4 — Timeboxing: Attach realistic windows (e.g., 4-8s) aligned with the drill\'s tempo and player level.
Step 5 — Pattern Design: Build a fixed, pre-programmed JSON pattern (phases, nodes, colors, durations). No mid-drill edits. No player-driven lighting.
Step 6 — Instructions: Write clear, minimal rules that tell players exactly what to do when the light appears and when it ends.
Step 7 — Coaching Points: Emphasize scanning before receiving, first touch to next action, support angles, collective timing, and defender behaviors on cue.
Step 8 — Progressions: Scale difficulty by increasing required actions, shrinking time windows, or adding spatial constraints (e.g., mandatory switch).

CUE DESIGN TAXONOMY (ATTACH DECISIONS TO LIGHTS)
- Redirect: Cue dictates direction or target (e.g., switch across grid; play to far-side gate; finish into specified channel).
- Trigger: Cue initiates an action (e.g., 3 passes in 6s; 1-touch sequence; immediate press; overlap run).
- Designate: Cue selects who/where is active (e.g., lit zone = “hot” receiving area; lit gate = entry point; lit team = limited receiving rights). Note: If patterns cannot adapt to team identity mid-drill, use neutral/global cues.

RULES FOR WRITING EYEQ DRILL INSTRUCTIONS
- Keep the original drill\'s essence (purpose, roles, flow) but insert a single, decisive cue rule.
- One cue = one action with success/failure consequence (e.g., success → continue; fail → turnover/reset).
- Clarity hierarchy in text:
  1) WHEN the cue appears (what players must watch)
  2) WHAT action is required (exact rule)
  3) HOW LONG they have
  4) WHAT happens if they succeed/fail
- Do not rely on team-color-linked cones if the app can\'t adapt mid-drill. Prefer neutral cues.

JSON PATTERN DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Nodes: Explicitly map nodes to cone positions (e.g., N/E/S/W lines or corner cones). Keep 1-18 total.
- Colors: Use only allowed colors (Red/Blue/Green/Yellow/Black[off]). If color semantics matter, state them in the drill text.
- Phases: Each phase contains all nodes with explicit color + duration. No omissions.
- Timing: Choose windows that match ball tempo and cognitive challenge (e.g., 6s for 3 passes); include dark intervals to reset focus.
- Independence: Pattern must be fully valid with no external state awareness; players\' actions never change light timing.
- Consistency & Fairness: Rotate which node is lit to avoid predictability, but never change patterns during the exercise (respect fixed-sequence constraint).

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (BEFORE FINALIZING)
- Does the cue add genuine scanning and a clear decision? If no, don\'t apply EyeQ.
- Is the cue-action mapping unambiguous and easy to explain in one sentence?
- Are time windows achievable yet challenging for the target level?
- Will the drill flow if the cue appears at awkward times (independence tolerance)?
- Does the JSON match the written instructions (colors, nodes, durations)?

EXAMPLE CONVERSION (STANDARD → EYEQ)
User\'s Standard Drill: “4v2 rondo, 10x10. Players keep possession; switch ball to opposite corner when appropriate.”
EyeQ Version:
- Setup: 4 EyeQ cones at corners. One cone lights Green at a time for 3-5s, rotating.
- Rule: Only pass into a corner if that corner\'s cone is Green; otherwise retain and recycle.
- Effect: Players must pre-scan corners before receiving; ball speed and body shape adjust to predictive scanning.
- JSON Sketch: Phases lighting each corner Green sequentially with short dark pauses.
- Coaching Points: Pre-orient, take snapshots before the ball arrives, play what\'s lit, not what\'s nearest.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE (NEUTRAL-CUE CHAOS POSSESSION)
Original Idea: 3 teams, 2 in possession vs 1 defender team, with constant transitions.
EyeQ Implementation (neutral cue):
- Setup: 4 neutral cones at sideline midpoints.
- Rule: When any cone lights Yellow, the team in possession must complete 3 passes within 6 seconds; the partner possession team cannot receive during the window but must move to create space; on success continue, on failure turnover.
- Rationale: Works with fixed patterns (no mid-drill adaptiveness). Cue is always valid; scanning is continuous.
- JSON Sketch: Rotating Yellow windows across cones with dark intervals.

COACHING LANGUAGE TEMPLATES (DELIVERY ON PITCH)
- “When the light appears, you have X seconds to complete Y. If you miss it, ball turns over.”
- “Scan before you receive; first touch sets the next pass; partner team moves but doesn\'t receive during the window.”
- “Defenders: the light is your pressing trigger—go now.”

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS (MODEL)
For each conversion, the model must output:
1) Clean drill title.
2) Objective (cognitive + tactical).
3) Setup (area, players, roles, equipment, cone count/placement).
4) How to Play (numbered steps, with cue rule stated precisely).
5) Coaching Points (scanning emphasis, first-touch, angles, pressing timing).
6) Progressions (increase passes, shorten windows, add switch/zone constraints).
7) JSON Pattern (nodes, colors, secs; phases covering entire pattern; fixed sequence; respects independence).

SUMMARY
- Preserve the base drill\'s purpose; insert one decisive cue that demands scanning and a timely action.
- Keep cues independent of players; design around fixed patterns and coach start/stop only.
- Make every cue meaningful: a specific, time-bound task with a clear success/failure consequence.
- Write instructions for players, not engineers—simple, actionable rules tied to the visible cue.
- Validate with the checklist before finalizing and ensure the JSON aligns perfectly with the written rules.
