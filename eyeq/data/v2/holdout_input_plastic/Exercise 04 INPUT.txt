Title: 5v2 Rondo with Press Trigger
Age group / phase: U12-U15, foundation to youth phase
Objective: Keep possession under pressure and react to pressing triggers.
Setup: 12x12m square with five attackers on the outside and two defenders inside. Balls with attackers.
How it plays / rules: Attackers keep the ball away from defenders. If a defender wins or forces a mistake, that defender stays in while the attacker who lost the ball becomes a defender. Play continuous.
Coaching focus: Quick passing, angles of support, recognize when pressure is tight and play away early.
Progressions: Two-touch maximum for attackers; shrink the square to increase pressure.
