Title: Wing Overlap to Finish — EyeQ Decision Wing Channel
Original core idea: Rehearse the winger’s decision to release an overlapping fullback or attack the box alone.
EyeQ setup: 30x20m channel with two standard plastic cones wide for winger start points and two for overlapping fullbacks. Two mini-goals at the end. Place two EyeQ Smart Cones on the end line just outside each mini-goal to signal the final action.
EyeQ rules (how it plays): Coach serves to winger. As the ball is traveling, one EyeQ Smart Cone on the end line lights up. Red = slip the overlapping fullback down the line to cross to that side. Green = cut inside and attack the opposite mini-goal yourself. The winger must scan before first touch, read the cue, and either feed the overlap or drive and finish. Rotate roles after each rep.
Coaching focus (key cues): Check the light as the pass travels; communicate early with the fullback; weight the release pass to match the runner; if cutting in, attack with speed and shoot across the keeper.
Why this respects and improves the original: The overlap pattern stays, but the light removes predictable repetition. The winger now scans for information and adapts the final action instead of rehearsing a single choice.
Progressions: Add a recovering defender; reduce time from light to finish; vary service height so the winger adjusts first touch while still responding to the cue.
