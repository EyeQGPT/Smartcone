Title: Four Gate Transition — EyeQ Counter Hunt
Original core idea: Win the ball and break forward through one of four gates before the opponent recovers.
EyeQ setup: 20x20m square marked by standard plastic gates on each side. Four EyeQ Smart Cones sit just beyond each gate to show the live target. Play 4v4 with a neutral server and spare balls.
EyeQ rules (how it plays): Server feeds one team. When the other team regains, a single EyeQ Smart Cone flashes to mark the live counter gate. The team that won the ball must scan, stretch the width, and sprint the ball through the lit gate within a few seconds to score. If they hesitate, the light can change to a different gate, forcing a second scan and switch.
Coaching focus (key cues): Immediate head-up on regain; first touch forward toward space; communicate who is running and who is supporting; accelerate once the light is spotted.
Why this respects and improves the original: Still a transition-to-gate game, but the light makes players search for the scoring side instead of pre-choosing one. It rewards fast scanning and collective reaction.
Progressions: Shorten the response window before the light can flip; allow a defender to chase through the gate; require the first pass after regain to break the midfield line before running to the light.
