Title: Triangle Check and Play
Age group / phase: U11-U13, foundation phase
Objective: Improve receiving on the move and playing forward after checking shoulders.
Setup: Three plastic cones in a triangle (8m sides). One player starts at Cone A with a ball; teammates at Cone B and Cone C without balls.
How it plays / rules: Player at A passes to B, follows, and rotates to B. Player at B checks away, receives, and plays to C. Pattern continues around the triangle with constant checking before receiving.
Coaching focus: Scan before the ball arrives, open body to see next option, first touch forward when possible, crisp passes.
Progressions: 1) Add a passive defender shadowing the receiver. 2) Limit touches to two.
