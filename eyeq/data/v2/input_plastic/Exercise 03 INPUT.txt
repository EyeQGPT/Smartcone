Title: Wing Overlap to Finish
Age group / phase: U15-U17, youth development phase
Objective: Train timing of overlaps and picking final pass in the box.
Setup: Channel 30x20m with a wide cone on each side for wingers, a cone for overlapping fullback start positions, and two mini-goals in the box area. Balls with a coach at halfway.
How it plays / rules: Winger receives from coach, drives down the line, and triggers overlapping fullback. Winger chooses to slip the overlap or cut inside to shoot or cross to mini-goals. Rotate roles every few reps.
Coaching focus: Early communication on overlap, winger scans before driving, weight of pass into overlap, decision to cut or release.
Progressions: Add recovering defender; restrict winger to two touches before deciding.
