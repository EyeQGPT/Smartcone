Title: Four Gate Transition
Age group / phase: U14-U16, youth development phase
Objective: Encourage quick transition from defense to attack through target gates.
Setup: Square grid 20x20m marked with four small gates on each side using plastic cones. Two teams of 4v4 plus neutral server with spare balls.
How it plays / rules: Server plays into one team to start. If defenders win the ball, they must counter quickly through any gate to score a point. Play restarts from server after each goal/out.
Coaching focus: Fast reaction on regain, first pass forward if possible, spread to width to find open gate, communication.
Progressions: Restrict time to score after regain; add a trailing defender who can tag runners through gates.
