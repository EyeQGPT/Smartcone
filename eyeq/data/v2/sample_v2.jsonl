One player starts at Cone A with a ball; teammates at Cone B and Cone C without balls.\nHow it plays / rules: Player at A passes to B, follows, and rotates to B. Player at B checks away, receives, and plays to C. Pattern continues around the triangle with constant checking before receiving.\nCoaching focus: Scan before the ball arrives, open body to see next option, first touch forward when possible, crisp passes.\nProgressions: 1) Add a passive defender shadowing the receiver. 2) Limit touches to two."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Title: Triangle Check and Play — EyeQ Scan Loop\nSetup: Three EyeQ Smart Cones form an 8m triangle. A ball starts at Cone A; players rotate clockwise. Lights run independently and only signal the next target.\nHow it plays: Player at A passes to B. As the ball travels, Cone B flashes a color to show the next option: red = play to C, green = bounce back to A. Receiver scans before first touch, adjusts body to the signal, and plays accordingly before rotating. Lights keep cycling so every pass demands a scan.\nCoaching focus: Scan as the ball leaves the passer; open hips toward both options; firm first touch out of feet; pass with tempo that keeps the triangle alive.\nProgressions: Add a passive defender at each receiving point; shrink the triangle to speed up reactions; require two-touch play only when the light shows red."}]}

Two teams of 4v4 plus neutral server with spare balls.\nHow it plays / rules: Server plays into one team to start. If defenders win the ball, they must counter quickly through any gate to score a point.

Four EyeQ Smart Cones sit just beyond each gate to show the live target. Play 4v4 with a neutral server and spare balls.\nHow it plays: Server feeds one team. When the other team regains, a single EyeQ Smart Cone flashes to mark the live counter gate. The team that won the ball must scan, stretch the width, and sprint the ball through the lit gate within a few seconds to score. If they hesitate, the light can change to a different gate, forcing a second scan and switch.\nCoaching focus: Immediate head-up on regain; first touch forward toward space; communicate who is running and who is supporting; accelerate once the light is spotted.\nProgressions: Shorten the response window before the light can flip; allow a defender to chase through the gate; require the first pass after regain to break the midfield line before running to the light."}]}
