One player starts at Cone A with a ball; teammates at Cone B and Cone C without balls.\nHow it plays / rules: Player at A passes to B, follows, and rotates to B. Player at B checks away, receives, and plays to C. Pattern continues around the triangle with constant checking before receiving.\nCoaching focus: Scan before the ball arrives, open body to see next option, first touch forward when possible, crisp passes.\nProgressions: 1) Add a passive defender shadowing the receiver. 2) Limit touches to two."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Title: Triangle Check and Play — EyeQ Scan Loop\nOriginal core idea: Quick passing around a triangle that rewards checking shoulders before receiving so the next pass is already pictured.\nEyeQ setup: Three EyeQ Smart Cones form an 8m triangle. A ball starts at Cone A; players rotate clockwise. Lights run independently and only signal the next target.\nEyeQ rules (how it plays): Player at A passes to B. As the ball travels, Cone B flashes a color to show the next option: red = play to C, green = bounce back to A. Receiver scans before first touch, adjusts body to the signal, and plays accordingly before rotating. Lights keep cycling so every pass demands a scan.\nCoaching focus (key cues): Scan as the ball leaves the passer; open hips toward both options; firm first touch out of feet; pass with tempo that keeps the triangle alive.\nWhy this respects and improves the original: Still a three-point passing loop, but the light forces the receiver to truly check for information instead of repeating a memorized pattern. Decision-making happens on every ball.\nProgressions: Add a passive defender at each receiving point; shrink the triangle to speed up reactions; require two-touch play only when the light shows red."}]}

Two teams of 4v4 plus neutral server with spare balls.\nHow it plays / rules: Server plays into one team to start. If defenders win the ball, they must counter quickly through any gate to score a point. Play restarts from server after each goal/out.\nCoaching focus: Fast reaction on regain, first pass forward if possible, spread to width to find open gate, communication.\nProgressions: Restrict time to score after regain; add a trailing defender who can tag runners through gates."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Title: Four Gate Transition — EyeQ Counter Hunt\nOriginal core idea: Win the ball and break forward through one of four gates before the opponent recovers.\nEyeQ setup: 20x20m square marked by standard plastic gates on each side. Four EyeQ Smart Cones sit just beyond each gate to show the live target. Play 4v4 with a neutral server and spare balls.\nEyeQ rules (how it plays): Server feeds one team. When the other team regains, a single EyeQ Smart Cone flashes to mark the live counter gate. The team that won the ball must scan, stretch the width, and sprint the ball through the lit gate within a few seconds to score. If they hesitate, the light can change to a different gate, forcing a second scan and switch.\nCoaching focus (key cues): Immediate head-up on regain; first touch forward toward space; communicate who is running and who is supporting; accelerate once the light is spotted.\nWhy this respects and improves the original: Still a transition-to-gate game, but the light makes players search for the scoring side instead of pre-choosing one. It rewards fast scanning and collective reaction.\nProgressions: Shorten the response window before the light can flip; allow a defender to chase through the gate; require the first pass after regain to break the midfield line before running to the light."}]}

Balls with a coach at halfway.\nHow it plays / rules: Winger receives from coach, drives down the line, and triggers overlapping fullback. Winger chooses to slip the overlap or cut inside to shoot or cross to mini-goals. Rotate roles every few reps.\nCoaching focus: Early communication on overlap, winger scans before driving, weight of pass into overlap, decision to cut or release.\nProgressions: Add recovering defender; restrict winger to two touches before deciding."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Title: Wing Overlap to Finish — EyeQ Decision Wing Channel\nOriginal core idea: Rehearse the winger’s decision to release an overlapping fullback or attack the box alone.\nEyeQ setup: 30x20m channel with two standard plastic cones wide for winger start points and two for overlapping fullbacks. Two mini-goals at the end. Place two EyeQ Smart Cones on the end line just outside each mini-goal to signal the final action.\nEyeQ rules (how it plays): Coach serves to winger. As the ball is traveling, one EyeQ Smart Cone on the end line lights up. Red = slip the overlapping fullback down the line to cross to that side. Green = cut inside and attack the opposite mini-goal yourself. The winger must scan before first touch, read the cue, and either feed the overlap or drive and finish. Rotate roles after each rep.\nCoaching focus (key cues): Check the light as the pass travels; communicate early with the fullback; weight the release pass to match the runner; if cutting in, attack with speed and shoot across the keeper.\nWhy this respects and improves the original: The overlap pattern stays, but the light removes predictable repetition. The winger now scans for information and adapts the final action instead of rehearsing a single choice.\nProgressions: Add a recovering defender; reduce time from light to finish; vary service height so the winger adjusts first touch while still responding to the cue."}]}
